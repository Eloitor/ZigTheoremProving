Inspired by [Formality](https://github.com/moonad/Formality), I'm attempting to reproduce its proofs inside of Zig. If this tests work. Expect a transpiler form Formality to Zig soon!

## Running the tests

Install [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) in your system (current version 0.7.0) and run
```bash
zig test Nat.zig
```
